Brainglobe sphinx config
========================

This package stores custom sphinx configuration that can be used to give documentation for Brainglobe projects a consistent look.
It acts as a thin wrapper around the ``pydata-sphinx-theme`` to:

- Add the logo to the navbar
- Define a static custom set of navbar links
